### My Story

From my early days as at CERN to my current role as an Algorithm Engineer at WhiteSpace Solutions, I've dedicated myself to mastering problem solving. My journey has been fueled by a love for tackling complex challenges and a commitment to continuous learning. When I'm not immersed in code, I enjoy collaborating with teams to build innovative solutions that make a real impact.
